Project Title:
🛒 Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering



Project Description:
This project aims to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using the K-Means Clustering algorithm. By analyzing customer purchasing behavior, the model identifies distinct customer segments that can help businesses understand customer patterns and design targeted marketing strategies. The project involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method, and visualizing the final customer groups.



Algorithm Used:
K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)


Tools & Technologies:
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Scikit-learn




Key Objectives:
Analyze customer purchase data
Segment customers into meaningful groups
Visualize clusters for better interpretation
Gain insights into customer behavior
